    old "{size=+10}{b}{u}Syl'tin{/u}{/b}{/size}{size=+1}\n\nAncient homeland to the Dark Elves (Tindi) and Drow - Syl'tin is where humans first landed on Syl'anar 312 years ago which began the age of the new era. \n\n{b}{u}Etymology:{/u}{/b} \n\n'Syl'tin' is the humanized name given to the land of Sylve'Tindi, which roughly translates to 'Elves of the Jungle'. \n\n{b}{u}Geography and Flora:{/u}{/b} \n\nOver 90 percent of Syl'tin's geography consists of a dense jungle biome that was once quite hostile to human and elvish life. Before humans arrived it was noticed that many of the twisting roads were well maintained even in the jungle - nearly appearing as a web of gardens connecting the villages to each other and to the other elvish worlds. Without constant maintainence, these gardens and their roads were overtaken by the jungle and lost. \nSyl'tin's geography is rocky and mountainous, though there are few mountains taller than sky scrapers. The Drow make their homes in found caves primarily in the west where the mountains are most common.{/size}"

    old "{size=+10}{b}{u}Syl'osi{/u}{/b}{/size}{size=+1}\n\nHome to the Common Elves (Alari). Though it is suspected another species may have once inhabited this land long ago, that was not the case when humans arrived. \n\n{b}{u}Etymology:{/u}{/b} \n\n'Syl'osi' is the humanized name given to the land of Sylve'Alosi, which roughly translates to 'Elves of the Snow'. \n\n{b}{u}Geography and Flora:{/u}{/b} \n\nSyl'osi consists of two parts; Mainland Syl'osi and the subcontinent of Kiir'vor. While it has not snowed often in Syl'anar since the end of the Industrial Revolution, Kiir'vor is still known for the occasional winter blizzard and is a popular tourist location because of this. Syl'osi has many hills and spruce forests, while Kiir'vor has the most mountainous region on the whole continent.{/size}"

    old "{size=+10}{b}{u}Syl'tali{/u}{/b}{/size}{size=+1}\n\nHome to the Desert Elves (Talvi). Those who have called this land home for centuries have found ways to make the most of their situation. \n\n{b}{u}Etymology:{/u}{/b} \n\n'Syl'tali' is the humanized name given to the land of Sylve'Talvi, which roughly translates to 'Elves of the Desert'. \n\n{b}{u}Geography and Flora:{/u}{/b} \n\nSyl'tali is an arid region, barely seeing any rain due to the southern mountain range that blocks this region from the rest of the continent. While this area is known for it's vast desert, most of this region conists of mountains - even being home to the largest mountain on the continent, which is said to be an ancient dormant volanco. This ancient volcano was once a thriving city inhabited by desert elves.{/size}"

As the heart of the continent, Syl'ari saw the most trade which eventually spawned the development of Syl'anar's capitol of Corpus.{/size}"

Due to this, it is believed this region was once entirely above the sea, only sinking in the past few hundred thousand years. Now only the hilltops remain.{/size}"
